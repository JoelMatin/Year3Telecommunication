# Year3Telecommunication
 
Hello reader,

This project was done for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the third year course ELEC-H311 - Signaux et systèmes de télécommunications - 202223 under the teaching of reknown searcher and professor François Horlin in the departement of Electrical Engineering.

The first part of the project was to code and use a phone and my PC as a radar system that could calculate based on the received signals emitted from the phones the distance between them. Lots of receiving, moduling, demoduling, FSK etc were used. The second part was about sending an image in the form of a sound wave from the phone to the PC and to demodulate the signal to draw the image back. Everything is in the pdf report "rapport.pdf". Enjoy !
